          visited and add places they wish to see. Users can follow fellow
          travelers and develop their network of travelers they admire, family
          and friends their trust, and people they share a similar travel style.

          information about a place. Since we aspire to provide you the best
          possible Platform user experience, we use the information we have to
          develop, test and improve our Platform, including by conducting
          surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and
